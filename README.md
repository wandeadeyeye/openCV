# openCV with Python Series

OpenCV-Python is an opensource library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems such as image analysis, video analysis, image processing, manipulation and so on.

OpenCV-Python makes use of Numpy, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy such as SciPy and Matplotlib.

OpenCV introduces a new set of tutorials which will guide you through various functions available in OpenCV-Python. This guide is mainly focused on OpenCV 2.x version.

in this series i will show you how to load images, draw things on images, analysis, face dectation and recongnition, object detection and recognitiong, track object moving around in an image or a video and so on.


## 01. OpenCV With Python - Introduction & Images
in this introduction and images, we will load and image, display the image, resize the image, rotate the image and save the rotated image
